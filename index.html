        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            "Coffee - the favorite drink of the civilized world." - Thomas Jefferson
            <br>
            No one knows exactly how or when coffee was discovered, though there are many legends about its
            origin. Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the
            Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved
            beans. The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from
            a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his
            findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him
            alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the
            monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.

        <h2>Types of beans</h2>
        <p>First of all, there are 3 main types of coffee beans. The names of these coffee beans are Robusta, Liberica
            and Arabica. There are also sub-types of these beans. But these are the main bean types. These types of
            beans take on different flavors while they are being processed and harvested. <br>
            Liberica: Liberica is a low yield type of coffee compared to Arabica and Robusta. <br>
            Robusta: This type of coffee, which contains 2.5% more caffeine than other types, has a pretty strong
            taste.<br>
            Arabica: This coffee bean with low caffeine and a smoother taste is aromatic and delicious. 80% of the
            coffee in the world is produced from these types of beans.

        <h2>The Only Way You Should Brew Coffee</h2>
        <p>One of the oldest, simplest, fastest and cheapest ways to brew coffee is the drip method using a coffee cone
            and paper filter. Hot water is poured evenly over coffee grounds in a paper filter. With gravity, the brewed
            coffee drips slowly and directly into a cup or pot. Coffee cones are made of plastic, glass, stainless steel
            or ceramic. The shape of the cone and their filters will influence the flavours. </p>
